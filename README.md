# Arduino-Buzzer-Song-Player
This is a small Arduino project which uses a buzzer module to play any simple musical melody.
The **notes, pauses and tempo** of the song **must be manually defined** in the script. Per default it plays the Nintendo Mii Theme and Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. The sheet music used can be found here:

The circuit used is a very simple buzzer circuit which looks like this:

(Make sure you use PIN 5 for the buzzer or change the buzzer integer in script to a different PIN.)

# LED Matrix Connect 4 Game
This project recreates the classic game Connect 4 using a 8x8 LED Matrix. It is intended as a two-player game were you take turns using the same button controls. The left and right buttons allow the player to move their dot from left to right and the button in the center is used to confirm the position and send the dot downwards.
