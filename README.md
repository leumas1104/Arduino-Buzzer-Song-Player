# Arduino-Buzzer-Song-Player
This is a small Arduino project which uses a buzzer module to play any simple musical melody.
The notes, pauses and tempo of the song must be manually defined in the script. The default melodies it plays are the Nintendo Mii Theme and Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. The sheet music used can be found here:

Make sure to use PIN 5 for the buzzer or change the buzzer integer in script to a different PIN.
