# Arduino-Buzzer-Song-Player
This is a small Arduino project which uses a buzzer module to play any simple musical melody.
The **notes, pauses and tempo** of the song **must be manually defined** in the script. Per default it plays the Nintendo Mii Theme and Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. The sheet music used can be found here:

The circuit used is a very simple buzzer circuit which looks like this:

(Make sure you use PIN 5 for the buzzer or change the buzzer integer in script to a different PIN.)
